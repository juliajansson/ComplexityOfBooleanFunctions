Haskell code implementing different parts of complexity of boolean functions:
* `DSLsofMath`: folder with useful material regarding polynomials from the course [DSLsofMath](https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath) at Chalmers University of Technology
* `EmptyTypeNats.hs`
* `Examples.hs`
* `FiniteEnum.hs`
* `Symbase.hs`: contains new polynomial representation that is useful for boolean functions
* `Types.hs`: main file containing everything from algorithms, boolean functions, calculation of expectation, checking if an algorithm is proper, and so on
