Haskell code implementing different parts of complexity of boolean functions:
* `DSLsofMath`: folder with useful material regarding polynomials from the course [DSLsofMath](https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath) at Chalmers University of Technology
* `EmptyTypeNats.hs`
* `Examples.hs`: contains examples of Boolean functions and their algorithms, such as majority, all, AC, iterated majority, and graph connectivity
* `FiniteEnum.hs`
* `GenAlg.hs`: a function for generating algorithms and some tests where we can see all algorithms generated for boolean functions like majority, graphs and AC
* `Symbase.hs`: contains new symmetric polynomial representation that is useful for boolean functions
* `Types.hs`: main file containing everything from algorithms, boolean functions, calculation of expectation, checking if an algorithm is proper, and so on
