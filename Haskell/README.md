Haskell code implementing different parts of complexity of boolean functions:

* `Tuple.hs`: tuples, and boolean functions
* `Alg.hs`: algorithms (= decision trees) for boolean functions, properAlg
* `Examples.hs`: contains examples of Boolean functions and their algorithms, such as majority, all, AC, iterated majority, and graph connectivity
* `Expectation.hs`: computes level-p complexity for algorithms
* `Symbase.hs`: contains new symmetric polynomial representation that is useful for boolean functions
* `GenAlg.hs`: a function for generating algorithms and some tests where we can see all algorithms generated for boolean functions like majority, graphs and AC

Helper modules:

* `FiniteEnum.hs`: brute-force enumeration of finite types
* `EmptyTypeNats.hs`: helper functions related to type level natural numbers
* `DSLsofMath`: folder with useful material regarding polynomials from the course [DSLsofMath](https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath) at Chalmers University of Technology
