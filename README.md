# ComplexityOfBooleanFunctions
Update: new code for paper at https://github.com/juliajansson/BoFunComplexity
Some code and calculations for my MSc thesis concerning Complexity of Boolean Functions at Chalmers University of Technology supervised by Professor Jeffrey Steif in the spring of 2022. Plots and figures are in the folder `plots`, all `Mathematica` code concerning mathematical calculations for the thesis, and `Haskell` code for generating algorithms, calculating expectation automatically, and a new polynomial representation.
