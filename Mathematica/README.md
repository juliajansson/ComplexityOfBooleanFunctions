Mathematica notebooks for calculating expected cost for different algorithms for boolean functions:
* `all.nb`: calculation and graph of Dp and lower bound for the all function 
* `maj2.nb`: lower bound for majority
* `iterated_maj.nb`: calculations and graphs for iterated majority
* `tribesDpScript.wls`: script for showing the Dp for tribes for different parameters, and saving the figures
* `graph.nb`: calculations of Dp for graph connectivity for different graphs, a bit messy
* `bimodal.nb`: example of function where the Dp has two maxima, calculation of all the different expected costs of the algorithms, with lots of intersections
